# Deep Q-Learning for Lunar Landing
This repository contains an implementation of Deep Q-Learning for solving the Lunar Lander problem using the Gymnasium environment. The agent learns to control a lunar lander to land smoothly on the moon's surface by optimizing its policy through Q-learning.

# Features
Deep Q-Network (DQN): Uses a neural network to approximate the Q-function.

Replay Memory: Stores past experiences to break correlations in training data.

Target Network: Stabilizes training by decoupling the target from the local network.

Epsilon-Greedy Policy: Balances exploration and exploitation during training.
